## How to Run Application

#### - Prerequisits

This project will only work on MacOS - Preferably a mac with an M-Series processor and not an Intel Processor. Make sure XCode & MacOS are both up-to-date!

##### Step 1
Using the Finder Application, open the main CrimsonCruiser Folder that you have downloaded.
##### Step 2

Within this folder, double click ( to open ) the **_CrimsonCruiser.xcodeproj_** file. 

##### Step 3

Wait a few seconds for the project to fully open in XCode. Then, in the Mac Menu Bar at the top of your screen, navigate to the ***"Product"*** Menu, and click the _**"Build"**_ button in the menu. 

This can also be achieved with the **_CMD + B_** keyboard shortcut.

Wiat a few seconds again. In the top right of the application it should eventually say "_Build_ **_Succeeded_**". This should take ~10 seconds.

##### Step 4

After the build succeeds, navigate back to the Product Menu again, and click the _**"Run"**_ button at the top of the menu. 

This can also be achieved with the **_CMD + R_** keyboard shortcut.

Now wait a few seconds. This may take a bit longer than building the application.

##### Step 5 ( *Important* )

After clicking run, but **before** the app actually launches, there will be a popup window asking you to trust the application in order for it to open! ***You must approve this!*** ( No worries, i am not doing anything nefarious :D )

##### Step 6 

A few seconds after approving the app, should now see it open. It looks like a minature 3D map of Harvard Yard with a bunch of green trees. If you have reached this point, keep reading the ***"How to Play"*** instruction! If you are encountering errors or issues, watch the video in the ***"Having Issues Starting the App?"*** section of this document.

## How to Play 

On the left and right of the app there are two "hover sensitive" areas that let you select the departure and destination locations! Once both have been selected, you should see the pathway on the 3D Map! Feel free to change your selections before starting to drive.

Once you have picked both locations, you can now click the ***"Start Driving"*** button.

Now, use the WASD Keys to drive the car. Unfortunately the driving experience is not very polished. If you encounter issues click R to reset the cars original position, or Q to return to the location selection screen. 

The goal is to follow the path to the destination location! At the top-center of the screen there is a **"Distance to Destination:"** that should help if you loose track of the path! You may not be able to perfectly follow certain paths... navigate around buildings to make it to your destination! 

Once you have reached your destination, you should see a congratulations message that tells you how long your journey was! Now you can select new locations and start again!
